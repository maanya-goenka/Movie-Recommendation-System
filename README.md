# Movie-Recommendation-System
A movie recommendation system based on AI principles and techniques such as tf-idf vectorization, cosine similarity, and Levenshtein Distance.

For the purposes of the self-guided assignment, I made a content based movie recommendation system that uses tf-idf vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies to the user based on an initial input - a movie name, and an integer representing the number of recommendations the user wants. The dataset used for generating recommendations is the imdb.csv dataset which consists of over 85000 movies (for the purposes of this recommendation system, the dataset has been limited to 25,000 movies in the interest of saving time and memory). If the movie input by the user is not one that is present in the dataset (misspelled movies are not in the dataset anyway), the system generates recommendations for a movie in the dataset with a title most similar to the one inputted by the user of the system; this is based on the concept of Levenshtein distance.
